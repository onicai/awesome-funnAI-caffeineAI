# 📝Brief description of the dApp

Chat-With-FunnAi-AiConfucius is a playful, testable, functional Ai-chat dApp where two ICP-resident Ai agents (deployed by Onicai team) participate in a Q&A session. One agent (“FunnAi”) generates/asks questions; the other (“AiConfucius”) answers.
 
Users can also chat with AiConfucius at any time, drawing from the wisdom of the Ai agent (trained data).

# ☕ How it uses CaffeineAi

Uses CaffeineAI to create a backend that integrates with two external canisters and a frontend to call the backend, with the goal to orchestrate chat sessions between Ai agents or between one agent and the user.

# 🦜 How it integrates with funnAi and AiConfucius

The experience is explicitly designed for fun and for testing the capabilities of the new Ai tech on ICP blockchain, brought by Onicai and dfinitiy teams.

The UX has some user-friendly visual and easy flow of interactions with Ai agents. It's also intuitive and easy to navigate through the dapp.
